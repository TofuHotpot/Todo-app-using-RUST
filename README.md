Hello ðŸ‘‹! Welcome to my first basic todo app that allows adding and removing tasks. It is using ICE which is a GUI library for Rust. 
Let's try it out! 

Open your shell, install/setup basic RUST (please refer here if you are unsure https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
Clone this project, type cargo run  in your shell to run this project. 
You can watch the video to have an idea how does this project works.

ENJOY :D ðŸ˜„
